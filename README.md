# smartGroceryList
A console program to help you buy healthy products

* There are two types of products:
 * - everyday products you buy to survive
 * - additional products to compensate any possible nutritional deficiencies
 *
 * This console program shows you two such additional products you should buy today.
 * It takes random products from a comprehensive list (50+)
 * of healthy products containing all things neccessary for your health
 * (all vitamins, minerals, indispensable amino acids, fatty acids)
 * plus additional things to improve your wellbeing
 * (cholesterol reductors and chocholate).
 * The list contains 3 products for every necessary thing.
 * From these 3 products one has a higher priority, and 2 others - lower priority
 * (the product with the highest nutritional value + 2 a bit lower value for diversity)
* you can edit lists of products and priorities by editing corresponding txt files.
